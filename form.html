            <p class="description">You watch ‚ÄúWhat? Where? When?‚Äù Yeah. Our founders used to play it. That‚Äôs where 
                they got a question about a famous American author and screenwriter Ray Bradbury. 
                Albeit, our CEO Gaga Darsalia forgot the exact name and he answered Ray Redberry. 
                And at that moment, a name for a yet to be born company was inspired - Redberry üòá</p>

            <h2 class="form-header"> A bit about our battles </h2>
            <p class="description">As we said, Redberry has been on the field for quite some time now, and we 
                have touched and embraced a variety of programming languages, technologies, philosophies, and 
                frameworks. We are battle-tested in PHP Laravel Stack with Vue.js, refined in React, and allies 
                with Serverside technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, and now we have set foot in the web3 
                industry.</p>

            <h2 class="form-header"> Redberry Covid Policies</h2>
            <p class="description">As this infamous pandemic took over the world, we adjusted our working practices 
                so that our employees can be as safe and comfortable as possible. We have a hybrid work environment, 
                so you can either work from home or visit our lovely office on Sairme Street. If it was up to us, we 
                would love you to see us in the office because we think face-to-face communications > Zoom meetings. 
                Both on the fun and productivity scales. </p>

            <p class="description">We were soo much fun before the pandemic started! Parties almost every weekend and 
                lavish employee birthday celebrations! Unfortunately, covid ruined that fun like it did almost 
                everything else in the world. But we try our best to zhuzh it up a bit. For example, we host biweekly 
                Devtalks where our senior and lead developers talk about topics they are passionate about. Previous 
                topics have included Web3, NFT, Laravel 9, Kubernetes, etc. We hold these talks in the office but you 
                can join our Zoom broadcast as well. Feel free to join either as an attendee or a speaker! </p>
